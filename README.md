This repository contains a complete **Spring MVC** project built using **Spring Boot**, **JSP**, and **Maven**. The project was developed as part of an internship and focuses on managing & updating employee data efficiently. It includes features for updating employee information using SSOID and sending verification emails upon updates. The application impliments **JDBC Template** for database interaction and uses **MySQL** as the database.

- Integrated various Spring Boot features like dependency injection and auto-configuration.

**Spring MVC Architecture:**

Working on this project was really exciting as I started from scratch in Spring and worked ahead to create a complete application within the timespan of 2 months. I learned a lot and enjoyed working with my mentors during this project, who helped me in navigating thorugh difficulties. I aim to develop bigger, more complex and better applications in this tech stack in the future.
